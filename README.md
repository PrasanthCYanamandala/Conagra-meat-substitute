# Conagra Brands Market Analysis – BUAN 6337.003

This repository contains an in-depth data analytics project conducted by Group 6 for the BUAN 6337.003 course. The project focuses on **Conagra Brands**, specifically their **Gardein** product line in the U.S. frozen meat substitutes market.

## 📊 Project Summary

The frozen meat substitutes market is rapidly evolving, and Gardein — despite being a top-5 player — faces stiff competition from brands like Beyond Meat, Impossible Foods, and MorningStar Farms. This project analyzes point-of-sale and promotional data to identify:

- Seasonal fluctuations in Gardein’s market share
- Regional and product-level performance trends
- Competitive strategies from rival brands
- Actionable opportunities for Conagra to grow Gardein’s presence

## 🎯 Objectives

- Understand brand-level market share trends across time
- Investigate the seasonal dip in Gardein’s performance during summer
- Identify which competitors are gaining during Gardein’s dips
- Analyze the effectiveness of promotions around key dates (e.g., July 4th)
- Explore regional performance and merchandising impacts
- Recommend product, packaging, and promotional strategies for growth

## 🔍 Key Insights

- **Summer Slumps**: Gardein sees consistent market share declines in July, potentially due to competition during Independence Day cookouts.
- **Top Competitor**: Beyond Meat spikes in July with aggressive promotions, often at Gardein’s expense.
- **Promotional Strategy**: Beyond increases discounts during key summer weeks, while Gardein does the opposite.
- **Product Form & Flavor**: Burger patties, nuggets, and breakfast items are top-performing forms. Original and spicy flavors lead.
- **Packaging**: Resealable plastic bags and vacuum-packed items are preferred by consumers.
- **Regional Weaknesses**: Gardein underperforms in the West, Plains, and Southeast. Product localization and spicy flavor development are needed.

## 💡 Recommendations

- Align promotional activity with seasonal events like July 4th.
- Expand breakfast offerings and spicy product lines.
- Target underperforming regions with localized campaigns.
- Increase availability of successful SKUs (e.g., burger patties, chicken wings).
- Explore merchandising and packaging improvements to boost shelf appeal.
